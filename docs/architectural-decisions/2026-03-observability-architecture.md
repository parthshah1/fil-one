# ADR: Observability Architecture for Serverless Wide Events

**Status:** Accepted
**Created:** 2026-03-24
**Last Modified:** 2026-04-14

## Context

We are building the management console for an S3-compatible object storage
product. The console runs on AWS Lambda and handles operations such as bucket
creation and deletion, access key management, object uploads and downloads, and
usage/billing queries. We need production observability that supports the "wide
event" pattern — emitting a single, context-rich structured event per request per
service, with many high-cardinality fields (account IDs, access key IDs, bucket
names, object keys, request IDs, feature flags, storage tier metadata, etc.).
This enables debugging through structured queries rather than grep-based log
archaeology.

Our constraints are:

- **AWS Lambda** is our primary compute platform.
- **Grafana** is our visualization and alerting layer (Grafana Cloud).
- **API Gateway V2 → CloudFront** is our routing layer — we want to keep this
  setup (no Lambda Function URLs).

We need an architecture that carries rich event data from Lambda functions to a
queryable backend, with reasonable cost, latency, and operational overhead.

### What we tried

Our first implementation (commits 2d1706d–7c3dcb7) used **two OTel Lambda
layers**: the upstream OTel Collector Extension running a sidecar collector
process, plus the OTel Node.js auto-instrumentation layer. This added ~1000ms
to every cold start and caused severely delayed telemetry from infrequent SQS
handlers. See Alternative A for details.

Our second implementation used the **manual OTel SDK** — no Lambda layers, no
sidecar, direct OTLP HTTP export to Grafana Cloud Tempo with synchronous
`forceFlush()`. This eliminated the cold start overhead from layers but
introduced a different problem: `forceFlush()` adds >500ms to cold-start
responses because AWS Lambda waits for the handler to complete before sending
the response. See Alternative B for details.

---

## Decision

**Lambda → `console.log` → CloudWatch Logs → Kinesis Firehose → Grafana Cloud
Loki** for logs. **CloudWatch Metrics → Metric Stream → Kinesis Firehose →
Grafana Cloud Prometheus** for metrics. No tracing or OpenTelemetry — the
performance penalty of synchronous trace export is too large for our Lambda +
API Gateway V2 setup.

### How it works

1. **Plain `console.log` for application logs.** Application logs use plain
   `console.log`/`warn`/`error` — no structured logging library needed. SST's
   `logging: { format: 'json' }` configures the Lambda runtime to emit JSON log
   records with `timestamp`, `level`, and `requestId` automatically.

2. **Log delivery via Firehose with CloudWatch retention.** Logs are written to
   CloudWatch Logs at standard ingestion ($0.50/GB) and kept with a short
   retention period (e.g. 7 days) for quick operational access via the AWS
   console. A Firehose subscription filter forwards the same logs to Grafana
   Cloud Loki for long-term storage and LogQL querying.

3. **Signal routing.**
   - **Logs → Loki** — JSON application logs with Lambda-injected `requestId`,
     plus API Gateway access logs (requestId, httpMethod, path, routeKey, status,
     responseLatency, integrationLatency, ip, userAgent). Both log streams use
     the same CloudWatch → Firehose → Loki pipeline with low-cardinality Loki
     labels (service, environment). LogQL for querying.
   - **Metrics → Prometheus** — AWS-provided metrics (Lambda invocations,
     duration, errors, throttles) via CloudWatch Metric Stream → Firehose →
     Grafana Cloud Prometheus. Custom application metrics via EMF planned as
     step 2. See below.
   - **Traces** — not implemented. Debugging relies on structured log queries
     in Loki, correlated by `requestId`.

4. **Debugging without traces.** Without distributed tracing, debugging relies
   on filtering logs by `requestId` in Loki (or CloudWatch Logs Insights for
   quick operational access). All contextual information needed for debugging
   should be logged explicitly. This is a tradeoff: we lose trace-based
   visualization and TraceQL queries, but gain zero telemetry overhead on every
   request.

### Metrics pipeline

Metrics delivery uses a two-step approach:

**Step 1 (implemented): AWS-provided metrics via CloudWatch Metric Stream.**

A CloudWatch Metric Stream forwards AWS-provided metrics (`AWS/Lambda`,
`AWS/ApiGateway`, `AWS/SQS`, `AWS/DynamoDB`) to Grafana Cloud
Prometheus via a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream. This gives us Lambda duration,
invocations, errors, throttles, API latency, queue depth, and table throttles in
Grafana dashboards with zero application code changes. The pipeline:

- CloudWatch Metrics → Metric Stream (OpenTelemetry 1.0 format) → Firehose →
  Grafana Cloud Prometheus (`aws-metric-streams` endpoint)

Additional AWS namespaces can be added to the Metric Stream's include filter
as needed.

CloudFront metrics are not yet included because CloudFront is a global service
whose metrics are only published in us-east-1, while our staging & production
stacks deploys to us-east-2.

**Deployment scope.** The metric stream pipeline is deployed once per account via
the `infra/` stack (not per-stage via the main stack), because CloudWatch Metric
Streams are account-wide — a single stream captures all metrics in the configured
namespaces regardless of which SST stage created the resources. This
avoids duplicate data from multiple stages sharing an account. Metric Streams
are also regional — if Lambdas are later deployed in multiple regions, a Metric
Stream is needed in each region. Developer stacks (which may use a different
region) do not get metrics streamed to Grafana; their metrics remain accessible
via the CloudWatch console.

**Step 2 (implemented): Custom application metrics via EMF.**

Aurora API calls (Portal and Backoffice) are instrumented with Hey API client
interceptors that emit CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF) JSON to stdout
via `process.stdout.write()`. Each Aurora API HTTP call produces one EMF line
with two metrics:

- `AuroraApiDuration` (Milliseconds) — response time of the upstream API call.
- `AuroraApiRequestCount` (Count, always 1) — enables rate and error-rate
  calculations via aggregation.

Dimensions (all low-cardinality):

- `apiName`: `"aurora-portal"` or `"aurora-backoffice"`.
- `endpoint`: HTTP method + URL template, e.g.
  `"POST /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/buckets"`. Derived from the Hey API SDK's
  URL template passed through `ResolvedRequestOptions.url`, so no manual
  endpoint map is needed.
- `statusGroup`: `"2xx"`, `"3xx"`, `"4xx"`, `"5xx"`, or `"network_error"`.

The exact HTTP `statusCode` is included as a non-dimension property for
log-level debugging.

**Why `process.stdout.write()` instead of `console.log()`:** Lambda's JSON log
format (`logging: { format: 'json' }`) wraps `console.log` output in a JSON
envelope, which double-encodes the EMF and prevents CloudWatch from extracting
metrics. Writing directly to stdout bypasses the Lambda formatter.

**Interceptor details:** A request interceptor records `performance.now()` in a
`WeakMap<Request, number>`. The response interceptor (which runs for all HTTP
responses, including 4xx/5xx) computes the duration and emits the EMF line. A
separate error interceptor handles network failures (where `response` is
`undefined`) to avoid double-counting with the response interceptor.

The Metric Stream's `includeFilters` includes the `FilOne` custom namespace,
so EMF-extracted metrics flow through the existing Firehose pipeline to Grafana
Cloud Prometheus.

**PromQL examples:**

- Error rate:
  `sum(rate(AuroraApiRequestCount{statusGroup!="2xx"}[5m])) / sum(rate(AuroraApiRequestCount[5m]))`
- p99 duration: use `AuroraApiDuration` with appropriate histogram/summary queries.

**Convention: no `stage` dimension on custom metrics.** Production and staging
run in separate AWS accounts, so their CloudWatch Metric Streams are
segregated at the source. Adding `stage` to EMF dimensions is redundant and
inflates time-series count. When defining a new metric, prefer
`Dimensions: [[]]` (see `subscription-drift-checker.ts` and `InvoicePaid` in
`stripe-webhook.ts`) unless the metric needs to be sliced by a signal-bearing
facet (`apiName`, `statusGroup`, etc.). Note that the `stage` field on
`DunningEscalation` refers to a dunning lifecycle stage — not a deployment
stage — and is signal-bearing.

### Lambda configuration

JSON log formatting is configured per Lambda via our `createFunction` helper in
`sst.config.ts`, which sets `logging: { format: 'json' }` on each function
definition.

### Alternative A: OTel Lambda Extension Layers (implemented, then replaced)

Use two Lambda layers — the upstream OTel Collector Extension running a sidecar
collector process, plus the OTel Node.js auto-instrumentation layer wrapping
handlers via `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER=/opt/otel-handler`.

**We implemented this approach (commits 2d1706d–7c3dcb7) and rejected it after
deployment:**

- **Excessive cold start overhead.** The two layers combined added ~1000ms to
  cold starts. For API handlers where p99 latency matters, this was
  unacceptable.
- **Severely delayed telemetry from infrequent SQS handlers.** The `decouple`
  processor defers export to the next invocation — for handlers invoked
  infrequently (e.g. tenant setup), telemetry sat in the collector's buffer for
  hours or days, making semi-realtime observability impossible. A separate
  `collector-sync.yaml` config without `decouple` mitigated this but was easy
  to misconfigure.
- **Operational complexity.** Custom collector configs with `decouple`
  processor, `basicauth` extension, Secrets Manager lookups, and `telemetryapi`
  receiver configuration added significant surface area to debug when telemetry
  wasn't arriving.
- **Log pipeline coupling.** Application logs via `@opentelemetry/api-logs`
  required the collector extension to receive and forward log records. If the
  collector process failed, both traces and logs were lost.

### Alternative B: Manual OTel SDK → Grafana Cloud Tempo (implemented, then replaced)

Each Lambda function initializes an OTel `TracerProvider` with
`BatchSpanProcessor` and `OTLPTraceExporter` at module load. No Lambda layers,
no sidecar collector. Wide-event context is attached as span attributes,
queryable via TraceQL in Tempo. Before the handler returns, `forceFlush()` sends
a single OTLP HTTP POST to Grafana Cloud. Logs use plain `console.log` via the
CloudWatch → Firehose → Loki pipeline (same as the chosen approach). Metrics
were to be auto-derived from spans via Tempo's metrics-generator.

**We implemented this approach and rejected it due to two problems:**

- **`forceFlush()` adds >500ms to cold-start responses.** AWS Lambda waits for
  the handler to complete — including the OTLP HTTP POST — before sending the
  response to the client. On cold starts, this adds >500ms of user-visible
  latency, pushing total browser response times well over 1 second. Warm
  invocations are fine (<100ms total), but cold starts happen frequently enough
  to be unacceptable. Lambda response streaming could defer the flush to after
  the response, but API Gateway V2 does not support streaming — it only works
  with Lambda Function URLs (`InvokeMode: RESPONSE_STREAM`), and we want to
  keep our ApiGatewayV2 → CloudFront routing.
- **Metrics-generation from spans is hard to set up in Grafana Cloud.**
  Tempo's metrics-generator is disabled by default in Grafana Cloud. Enabling
  it requires either Application Observability (which only generates metrics
  for SERVER and CONSUMER span kinds by default — missing CLIENT spans like
  Auth0 calls) or contacting Grafana Support for custom settings. Neither
  option is self-service or IaC-friendly.

### Alternative D: ADOT Lambda Layers

AWS's own distribution of the OTel Lambda layer (ADOT) with Application Signals.

**Why we rejected it:**

- **Even worse cold starts.** ADOT layers add 200–500ms for newer versions, and
  500ms–4s for legacy collector-based versions. AWS labels the legacy
  collector-based approach "not recommended."
- **No advantage for Grafana Cloud export.** Exporting to non-CloudWatch
  endpoints (like Grafana Cloud OTLP) still requires the legacy layer with
  embedded collector — the newer Application Signals approach only supports
  CloudWatch/X-Ray destinations.

### Alternative E: Grafana's OTel Collector Lambda Extension

Grafana provides a pre-configured distribution of the OTel Collector Lambda
Extension optimized for Grafana Cloud. It uses the `decouple` processor for
async flush and stores API keys in AWS Secrets Manager.

**Why we rejected it:**

- **Same cold start problem.** Still carries 100–300ms cold start overhead from
  the collector extension process — less than the two-layer setup we tried, but
  still significant. Combined with the auto-instrumentation layer, total cold
  start overhead approaches what we measured.
- **Same decouple problem.** Async flush via `decouple` causes the same delayed
  telemetry issue for infrequently-invoked handlers.
- **Grafana Alloy is not an alternative for Lambda.** Grafana Alloy is designed
  for persistent processes and does not run as a Lambda extension. Grafana
  recommends deploying Alloy on EC2/ECS as a gateway collector — adding
  infrastructure we want to avoid.

### Alternative F: Lambda → Kinesis Firehose → Grafana Tempo

Route wide events through Kinesis Data Firehose using its HTTP endpoint
destination to push trace data to Tempo.

**Why we rejected it:**

- **Protocol mismatch.** Grafana Cloud built a Firehose-compatible endpoint
  (`aws-logs/api/v1/push`), but it only accepts **logs destined for Loki**, not
  traces for Tempo. Tempo ingests exclusively via OTLP (gRPC/HTTP), Jaeger, or
  Zipkin protocols.
- **No Firehose-to-OTLP path.** Firehose uses a proprietary JSON envelope
  format with custom headers (`X-Amz-Firehose-Protocol-Version`,
  `X-Amz-Firehose-Request-Id`) and authenticates via `X-Amz-Firehose-Access-Key`.
  Tempo expects standard `Authorization` headers. There is no built-in
  transformation — a translation layer (OTel Collector fleet or API Gateway +
  Lambda) is required.
- **Latency.** Firehose buffers with a minimum 60-second delivery interval.
  Wide events would arrive at Tempo with at least a one-minute delay.
- **X-Ray does not export to Firehose.** X-Ray has its own data store and API
  with no Firehose pipeline, so this approach cannot leverage existing tracing.
- **Double cost.** Firehose ingestion per GB, plus translation compute, plus
  Tempo ingestion — when direct OTLP export eliminates the first two.

Note: Firehose is excellent for _logs_ — we use it for the Lambda → CloudWatch →
Firehose → Loki pipeline. The rejection applies only to using Firehose for trace
data.

### Alternative G: Lambda → Wide-event JSON logs → Grafana Loki

Emit wide events as structured JSON log lines and store them directly in Loki.

**Why we rejected it:**

- **Cardinality explosion.** Loki indexes by low-cardinality labels. Using
  high-cardinality wide-event fields as labels creates massive index bloat.
  Loki defaults to a limit of 15 index labels.
- **Structured metadata is scan-based.** Loki's structured metadata feature can
  store high-cardinality fields without indexing them, but querying them is a
  brute-force scan, not an index lookup. Broad analytical queries over large
  time ranges become slow.
- **No columnar query model.** LogQL parses JSON from each matching log line at
  query time — fundamentally different from Tempo's columnar storage where each
  attribute is queryable directly. Aggregation queries are significantly slower.
- **Log volume cost.** A 50-field wide event at ~1–2KB per request becomes
  expensive at scale on Grafana Cloud's per-GB Loki pricing. Tempo's storage
  model is more efficient for structured span data.

### Alternative H: X-Ray traces + CloudWatch logs, queried from Grafana

Use X-Ray for traces and CloudWatch for logs, with Grafana querying both
in-place via data source plugins — no data movement required.

**Why we rejected it:**

- **Wide event support is constrained.** X-Ray supports up to 50 annotations
  per trace (indexed, searchable), with a 64KB segment document limit. Metadata
  accepts any JSON but is not indexed or searchable — only viewable on the full
  trace. Insufficient for the wide-event pattern.
- **One-directional log-trace correlation.** Lambda sets `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` on
  every invocation and logs can link to X-Ray traces, but the X-Ray data source
  does not natively support trace-to-logs navigation. No bidirectional
  correlation like Tempo ↔ Loki.
- **Sluggish query performance.** CloudWatch Logs Insights queries take 5–30+
  seconds for large datasets; X-Ray trace queries take 1–5 seconds. Noticeably
  slower than sub-second responses from pre-stored Loki/Tempo data, especially
  during interactive debugging sessions.
- **X-Ray SDK deprecation.** AWS announced X-Ray SDKs enter maintenance mode
  February 2026, with end-of-support February 2027. AWS now recommends
  migrating to OTel/ADOT. Risky for a new project.
- **X-Ray and OTel use different propagation headers.** X-Ray propagates via
  `X-Amzn-Trace-Id` in a proprietary format; OTel uses W3C `traceparent`. If
  we later migrate some functions to OTel, trace context is lost at the
  boundary — disconnected traces instead of one connected graph. Choosing OTel
  from the start avoids this migration hazard.

### Alternative I: Powertools for AWS Lambda (X-Ray + CloudWatch)

Use `@aws-lambda-powertools/tracer` + `@aws-lambda-powertools/logger` for the
simplest setup with the lowest cold start overhead of any trace-capable option.

**Advantages:**

- **Lowest cold start overhead (~50–100ms).** AWS explicitly states Powertools
  Tracer "relies on AWS X-Ray SDK over OpenTelemetry Distro (ADOT) for optimal
  cold start."
- **Excellent developer ergonomics.** `appendPersistentKeys()` enables
  progressive context enrichment through middleware — exactly the pattern we
  want for wide events on log lines.
- **Zero infrastructure.** No collector, no extension, no Firehose. Just npm
  packages and an X-Ray active tracing flag.

**Why we rejected it:**

- **Same X-Ray limitations as Alternative H** — 50-annotation limit, 64KB
  segment size, one-directional correlation, deprecation timeline.
- **Log enrichment ≠ trace enrichment.** `appendPersistentKeys()` enriches
  _log lines_, not trace spans. The Tracer's `putAnnotation()` (50 indexed) and
  `putMetadata()` (not indexed) are far more limited than OTel span attributes.
- **No tail sampling path.** X-Ray supports head-based sampling only. The only
  cost control lever discards errors and successes at the same rate.
- **Error capture is split across services.** X-Ray tells you _which requests
  failed_ (fault/error/throttle status); CloudWatch Logs tells you _why_ (full
  stack traces, context).

### Alternative J: All-native AWS (EMF + X-Ray + CloudWatch)

Use CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format for metrics, X-Ray for traces, and
CloudWatch Logs for structured events, with Grafana querying via data source
plugins. No data movement, no pipeline infrastructure.

**Advantages:**

- **Near-zero cold start overhead (<5ms).** EMF writes JSON to stdout (no
  network calls), X-Ray is handled by the Lambda platform, CloudWatch Logs is
  built-in. Orders of magnitude better than any OTel approach.
- **Zero infrastructure.** No pipeline, no data movement, no external services
  to manage.

**Why we rejected it:**

- **Severe query-time limitations.** CloudWatch Logs Insights takes 5–30+
  seconds for large datasets. X-Ray queries take 1–5 seconds. This lag
  compounds during interactive debugging sessions with iterative exploration.
- **EMF cardinality trap.** Every distinct dimension value creates a new
  CloudWatch Metric time series. High-cardinality values (userId, requestId) as
  dimensions generate massive custom metric counts and huge CloudWatch costs.
  Must use `setProperty()` for high-cardinality context (searchable in Logs
  Insights only, no metrics).
- **Split wide-event data.** Traces in X-Ray and logs in CloudWatch cannot be
  queried in one place. No unified wide-event-per-request view.
- **Vendor lock-in.** Instrumentation uses AWS-specific APIs rather than OTel,
  violating our vendor-neutrality constraint.
- **Loses Grafana Cloud features.** No TraceQL, no LogQL, no bidirectional
  correlation, no native Grafana alerting on pre-stored data.

Note: We adopt parts of Alternative J — specifically EMF for metrics — in the
chosen approach, but without X-Ray tracing and with Grafana Cloud (not
CloudWatch) as the query and alerting layer.

### Alternative K: AWS CloudWatch OTLP endpoints (GA 2025)

AWS now provides native OTLP ingestion at `https://xray.{region}.amazonaws.com/
v1/traces` for traces and `https://logs.{region}.amazonaws.com/v1/logs` for
logs, with SigV4 authentication.

**Why we rejected it:**

- **Traces still land in X-Ray, not Tempo.** Standard OTel SDKs can send
  directly to CloudWatch/X-Ray without ADOT-specific exporters, but the
  backend is still X-Ray with all its limitations (50 annotations, 64KB
  segments, limited query language).
- **Does not solve the wide-event problem.** The OTLP endpoint is a transport
  improvement, not a storage improvement — X-Ray's data model constraints
  remain.

### Alternative L: Lambda → OTel → ClickHouse → Grafana

Export wide events as OTLP traces to ClickHouse instead of Tempo.

**Advantages:**

- **Best analytical query performance.** ClickHouse excels at high-cardinality,
  high-dimensionality aggregation queries. It would outperform Tempo for complex
  analytical queries over large datasets.
- **Viable future evolution.** If we outgrow Loki's query capabilities, we can
  add ClickHouse as a secondary store without changing application
  instrumentation. This is a good "Phase 2" option.

**Why we deferred it (not rejected):**

- **Operational overhead.** Running a ClickHouse cluster is significantly more
  burden than Grafana Cloud's managed services. Schema design, cluster scaling,
  backups, and upgrades are our responsibility.
- **Loss of native Grafana stack integration.** ClickHouse as a trace backend
  requires custom dashboard work to achieve the UX that Grafana's native stack
  provides out of the box.

### Logging: console.log vs pino

We considered using pino for structured logging with automatic JSON field
injection.

**Advantages of pino:**

- **Structured log fields.** Pino emits JSON with typed fields, making LogQL
  queries like `| json | userId="123"` possible.
- **Progressive context enrichment.** Pino's child loggers can accumulate
  context through middleware, similar to wide events.

**Why we chose plain console.log instead:**

- **Zero dependencies.** No pino package to install, update, and debug. SST's
  `logging: { format: 'json' }` configures the Lambda runtime to provide
  `timestamp`, `level`, and `requestId` automatically.
- **Sufficient for current needs.** Log querying in Loki via LogQL with JSON
  parsing covers our current debugging needs. If structured log querying becomes
  important, migrating to pino is straightforward — it's an additive change.

---

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Zero telemetry overhead per request.** No OTel SDK, no `forceFlush()`, no
  network calls for telemetry. Logs go to stdout (near-zero cost), which is the
  fastest path in Lambda.
- **Simplest possible stack.** `console.log` + CloudWatch + Firehose + Loki.
  No OTel dependencies, no collector, no sidecar, no Lambda layers.
- **Independent log pipeline.** Logs flow via stdout → CloudWatch → Firehose →
  Loki. Fully managed, no application-level failure modes.
- **Cost-efficient.** Within Grafana Cloud free tier at current scale. Firehose
  log delivery at $0.029/GB is the cheapest managed option.
- **Verified log pipeline.** The CloudWatch → Firehose → Loki pipeline has been
  tested and confirmed working end-to-end.
- **AWS metrics in Grafana.** CloudWatch Metric Stream forwards AWS-provided
  metrics (Lambda, API Gateway, SQS, DynamoDB) to Grafana Cloud
  Prometheus with zero application code changes.
- **Custom Aurora API metrics.** EMF-based metrics for Aurora Portal and
  Backoffice API calls (duration, request count by status group) flow through
  the existing Metric Stream → Grafana Prometheus pipeline with zero additional
  infrastructure.

### Negative

- **No distributed tracing.** Debugging relies on log queries filtered by
  `requestId`, not trace visualization. No span-based latency analysis, no
  trace waterfall views, no TraceQL. This is a significant observability
  regression compared to the OTel approaches — acceptable at current scale
  where most debugging is single-request investigation.
- **Limited custom metrics coverage.** Aurora API calls have EMF metrics, but
  other application-level RED metrics (per-route rate, errors, duration for our
  own API handlers) are not yet instrumented.
- **Firehose infrastructure.** The log and metric pipelines each require a
  Firehose delivery stream plus supporting resources (S3 backup, IAM roles).
  Operationally simple but not zero.
- **Log-only wide events are limited.** High-cardinality fields in logs are
  queryable via LogQL JSON parsing, but this is scan-based — slower than
  Tempo's indexed span attributes for broad analytical queries.
