# S3 On-Ramp Testing

Three test suites for validating FilOne S3 on-ramps (Aurora, Akave, …):

1. **Upload, fetch, delete, and load tests** — targeted upload, fetch, delete, and load tests using the `harvard-lil/gov-data` dataset on source.coop. Files are streamed directly (source → on-ramp) without writing to disk.
2. **Compatibility Test** — runs the [ceph/s3-tests](https://github.com/ceph/s3-tests) suite (~750 tests) against an on-ramp to measure full S3 API compatibility.
3. **Console presigned-URL test** — verifies an on-ramp supports the presigned URL operations the FilOne Console issues and that they are executable from a browser running on `https://app.fil.one` (CORS).

Each on-ramp has its own directory (`aurora/`, `akave/`, …) holding its `.env`, logs, and reports. All scripts share a unified report format: timestamped files in `<on-ramp>/logs/` and `<on-ramp>/reports/`.

## Setup

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python dependency management.
See [Installing uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to get started.

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
cd tests/s3compat
uv sync                                      # installs deps from pyproject.toml
uv pip install -r ceph-s3-tests/requirements.txt  # needed for compatibility_test.py
```

**Configure credentials:**

```bash
cp env.example aurora/.env
# Edit aurora/.env — at minimum set S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID, S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, S3_BUCKET
```

All scripts must be run from the `tests/s3compat/` directory:

```bash
cd tests/s3compat
```

**Aurora-specific: Portal API token**

The Aurora S3 gateway does not expose `ListBuckets` / `CreateBucket` / `DeleteBucket` via S3 access-key auth; those operations go through the Aurora Portal API and require a per-tenant API key. The compatibility test (which creates/deletes buckets per test) and `tools/create_bucket.py` rely on this token being cached at `~/.aurora_token`.

The per-tenant key is provisioned by FilOne Console backend during tenant creation and stored in AWS SSM. Fetching it requires the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) on `PATH` and credentials configured for the AWS account that owns the parameter. Then run:

```bash
python tools/aurora_key_management.py login \
  --stage dev --region eu-west-1 --tenant-id <TENANT_ID>
```

This shells out to `aws ssm get-parameter --with-decryption` and writes the token to `~/.aurora_token` (chmod 600). Re-run when the cached token expires.

The runtime patch also reads `AURORA_PORTAL_ORIGIN` and `AURORA_TENANT_ID` from the environment. The same CLI exposes Portal-API helpers (`keys`, `get-key`, `create-key`, `delete-key`) and a Back Office–API `tenants` command (which uses a partner-level key from `AURORA_BACKOFFICE_API_KEY` / `AURORA_BACKOFFICE_ORIGIN`). See `python tools/aurora_key_management.py --help`.

## Basic Operations

### Upload

Streams files directly from source.coop → Aurora without local download. State saved to `manifest.json` after each file — re-running skips already-done keys.

```bash
# Upload 5 files up to 200 MB each (defaults)
python tools/upload.py --provider aurora

# Upload 10 files, skip anything over 50 MB
python tools/upload.py --provider aurora --count 10 --max-size-mb 50

# Different source prefix
python tools/upload.py --provider aurora --prefix gov-data/collections/
```

**Resume after failure:** re-run the same command. Done entries in `manifest.json` are skipped.

**Force re-upload** (ignore manifest, re-upload everything):

```bash
python tools/upload.py --provider aurora --force
python tools/upload.py --provider aurora --force --count 10
```

State files: `aurora/manifest.json`

### Fetch

Runs `HeadObject`, `GetObject` (first 1 KB preview), and `ListObjectVersions` on each uploaded key.

```bash
# Fetch all keys from manifest.json
python tools/fetch.py --provider aurora

# Fetch a specific key
python tools/fetch.py --provider aurora --key gov-data/README.md

# Fetch a specific version
python tools/fetch.py --provider aurora --key gov-data/README.md --version-id <version-id>
```

### Delete

```bash
# Preview what would be deleted (no changes made)
python tools/delete.py --provider aurora --dry-run

# Delete all done entries in manifest.json
python tools/delete.py --provider aurora

# Delete a specific key or version
python tools/delete.py --provider aurora --key gov-data/README.md
python tools/delete.py --provider aurora --key gov-data/README.md --version-id <version-id>
```

---

## Load Test

Concurrent uploads tracked in `load_test_state.db` (SQLite). Any interrupted run can be resumed exactly where it left off.

```bash
# Upload 50 files with 8 concurrent threads (defaults)
python load_test.py --provider aurora

# Upload 200 files with 16 threads
python load_test.py --provider aurora --count 200 --workers 16

# Resume after failure (retries pending/failed/interrupted entries)
python load_test.py --provider aurora --resume
python load_test.py --provider aurora --resume --workers 4

# Force re-run from scratch (deletes load_test_state.db and re-queues everything)
python load_test.py --provider aurora --force
python load_test.py --provider aurora --force --count 200 --workers 16
```

State files: `aurora/load_test_state.db`

**Failure handling:**
| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Network timeout mid-upload | Multipart upload aborted; entry marked `failed`; retried on `--resume` |
| Process killed mid-run | `in_progress` entries retried on `--resume` |
| Rate limit / HTTP error | Logged with status code and error body; retried on `--resume` |
| Source file unavailable | Logged as source error; retried on `--resume` |

---

## Compatibility Test

Runs the full [ceph/s3-tests](https://github.com/ceph/s3-tests) suite against Aurora. Auto-generates `s3tests.conf` from `.env`, runs pytest, and produces a unified report grouped by S3 feature category.

```bash
# Run core S3 tests, excluding tests known to fail on real AWS
python compatibility_test.py --provider aurora

# Custom mark expression
python compatibility_test.py --provider aurora --marks 'not fails_on_aws'
python compatibility_test.py --provider aurora --marks 'versioning and not fails_on_aws'
python compatibility_test.py --provider aurora --marks 'encryption'

# Run a single test
python compatibility_test.py --provider aurora --test-file 's3tests/functional/test_s3.py::test_bucket_list_empty'

# Run IAM tests
python compatibility_test.py --provider aurora --test-file s3tests/functional/test_iam.py
```

**`not fails_on_aws` (default marks):** The s3-tests suite tags some tests `fails_on_aws` — these are tests for Ceph-specific behavior that even real AWS S3 fails. Excluding them gives a cleaner compatibility signal.

**Cross-user tests:** Tests in the `[s3 alt]` category require a genuinely separate Aurora account (different user identity, not just a second API key on the same account). Add `S3_ALT_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `S3_ALT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to `aurora/.env`. Without a separate account, cross-user ACL tests will fail — single-user tests are unaffected.

**Report:** The BY CATEGORY section breaks results down by S3 feature (versioning, lifecycle, encryption, etc.) with pass/fail counts and timing stats per category. Only failures are shown in detail — passing test names are omitted to keep the report readable.

### Multi-pass test isolation (quarantine)

The compatibility test runs pytest in two passes to prevent cascading failures
from "poisoned buckets."

#### The problem

The ceph s3-tests suite cleans up test buckets before each test via
`nuke_prefixed_buckets()` in the shared setup fixture. If a previous test left
objects that can't be deleted (e.g. retention-locked objects), the cleanup raises
`BucketNotEmpty` and the next test gets outcome "error" without ever running its
actual test logic. The error cascades to every subsequent test.

#### Analysis (Akave, 2026-04-15)

In the first Akave full-suite run (595 tests, 172 errors), the errors clustered
into 6 contiguous runs:

| Run | Trigger test                                   | Cascade | Recovers? |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------: | --------- |
| 1   | `test_bucket_list_delimiter_basic`             |       2 | Yes       |
| 2   | `test_multi_object_delete_key_limit`           |      10 | Yes       |
| 3   | `test_bucket_create_special_key_names`         |       1 | Yes       |
| 4   | `test_multipart_copy_special_names`            |       1 | Yes       |
| 5   | `test_bucket_policy_upload_part_copy`          |       3 | Yes       |
| 6   | `test_object_lock_put_obj_retention_versionid` | **155** | **No**    |

Runs 1-5 are transient (17 tests combined) — the gateway's eventual consistency
allows cleanup to succeed after a few tests pass. Run 6 is permanent:
object-lock retention creates objects that return `AccessDenied` on delete. Once
this bucket exists, every subsequent test's setup fails.

#### Solution

`compatibility_test.py` splits the suite into two pytest passes:

1. **Main pass**: everything except `object_lock` tests
2. **Quarantine pass**: only `object_lock` tests (runs last)

Between passes, a best-effort bucket cleanup deletes all test buckets matching
the provider's prefix. Results from both passes are merged into a single unified
report.

This eliminates the 155-test cascade from run 6. Runs 1-5 still produce
occasional transient errors but recover on their own within the same pass.

The quarantine marks are configured in `_QUARANTINE_MARKS` in
`compatibility_test.py`. To quarantine additional marks, add them to the list.

#### Alternatives considered

- **Modify ceph-s3-tests cleanup code**: The test suite is a git submodule we
  don't own. Changes would be lost on submodule updates and diverge from
  upstream.
- **pytest-ordering or conftest.py reordering**: pytest doesn't support test
  reordering without a plugin, and adding a plugin to the submodule has the same
  ownership problem.
- **pytest-forked (one process per test)**: The problem is shared S3 server
  state, not in-process state. Process isolation doesn't help.
- **More granular passes (per-category)**: Runs 1-5 are transient and
  self-healing (17 tests combined). The added complexity of 5+ passes isn't
  justified when only run 6 (155 tests) causes permanent damage.
- **Skip object-lock tests entirely**: We still want to know their pass/fail
  status — we just don't want them to poison other tests.

## Console Presigned-URL Test

Verifies that an on-ramp can sign (with AWS Sig V4) every S3 operation the FilOne Console issues via its batch presign endpoint, and that the resulting URLs are executable from a browser running on `https://app.fil.one` — i.e., the bucket's CORS configuration permits them. Works against any on-ramp.

The operations tested are defined by the Console's [presign handler](../../packages/backend/src/handlers/presign.ts):

| Operation            | HTTP   | Notes                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `putObject`          | PUT    | Signs `Content-Type` + `x-amz-meta-*`; the browser must send them |
| `listObjects`        | GET    | `?list-type=2&prefix=…`                                           |
| `headObject`         | HEAD   | Plain head request                                                |
| `headObjectFilMeta`  | HEAD   | `?fil-include-meta=1` — response must expose `x-fil-cid`          |
| `getObject`          | GET    | Object download                                                   |
| `getObjectRetention` | GET    | `?retention` — 400/404 accepted (bucket may lack Object Lock)     |
| `deleteObject`       | DELETE | Delete by key                                                     |

For each operation up to four log entries are written:

1. `presign_<op>` — boto3 generated a Sig V4 URL.
2. `preflight_<op>` — OPTIONS from `Origin: https://app.fil.one` returned `Access-Control-Allow-{Origin,Methods,Headers}` covering the method and any custom request headers. **Only emitted for `putObject` (PUT) and `deleteObject` (DELETE).** Per the Fetch spec, browsers don't send a preflight for _simple_ requests (GET/HEAD with only CORS-safelisted headers), so the server's OPTIONS handling is irrelevant for those ops in a real browser and we skip the check.
3. `execute_<op>` — the signed URL succeeded over HTTP (or returned an S3 error listed as acceptable for that op).
4. `response_cors_<op>` — the actual response carries `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, and for HEAD/GET it also exposes the headers the browser needs to read (`ETag`, `Content-Length`, `Content-Type`, `Last-Modified`, plus `x-fil-cid` for the `fil-include-meta` variant; `x-amz-meta-*` must survive to the response for HEAD).

```bash
# Against the provider's default bucket (S3_BUCKET in <provider>/.env)
python console_presign_test.py --provider aurora

# Target a specific bucket
python console_presign_test.py --provider aurora --bucket my-bucket

# Simulate a different browser origin (for testing staging/dev domains)
python console_presign_test.py --provider aurora --browser-origin https://console.dev.fil.one
```

The script uploads one small test object at a random key under `console-presign-test/` and deletes it in a `finally` block so repeated runs do not leave debris — even if one of the mid-sequence operations fails.

### Bucket CORS configuration

The Console operations only work from a browser if the bucket's CORS policy permits the origin, methods, request headers, and exposed response headers the test exercises. How that configuration is applied depends on the provider:

| Provider   | CORS source                                  | Test behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Akave**  | S3 API (`PutBucketCors`)                     | The test captures the bucket's current CORS config, applies a rule tailored to the tested operations (origin, all methods, wildcard `AllowedHeaders`, the required `ExposeHeaders`), runs the checks, and restores the captured config in a `finally` block. |
| **Aurora** | Configured out-of-band at the edge/CDN layer | The test does not call `put_bucket_cors` — Aurora rejects it. The operator must ensure the edge CORS rules match what the test asserts.                                                                                                                      |

Providers that manage CORS via the S3 API are listed in `PROVIDERS_WITH_PUT_BUCKET_CORS` in `console_presign_test.py`.

The report's header lists the bucket's CORS configuration as read via `GetBucketCors` before the test runs, and — for providers that apply CORS themselves — the config after the test-applied rule. The test then restores the pre-existing config in a `finally` block so repeated runs do not leave behind the test's rule. Mismatches between what the Console needs and what the provider has configured are visible in one place.

## Running ceph-s3-tests Directly

The `compatibility_test.py` script auto-generates the config and wraps everything in a report. If you want to run `ceph-s3-tests` directly with tox or pytest — for faster iteration, specific test selection, or to get raw pytest output — follow these steps.

### Preconditions

Before any tests will pass, verify these requirements:

**1. Bucket creation must be allowed via API**

The s3-tests suite creates a fresh bucket for each test and deletes it in teardown. If your Aurora API key does not have `CreateBucket` / `DeleteBucket` permission, every test will fail immediately with `AccessDenied`. Confirm in the Aurora UI that your API key has full bucket management permissions, or contact Aurora support to enable it.

> This is the most likely reason tests fail out of the box. We observed `AccessDenied` on `CreateBucket` in initial testing.

**2. Two credential pairs for cross-user tests**

Any test that checks cross-account behavior (ACLs, cross-user bucket access, etc.) requires a second Aurora API key in `[s3 alt]`. Without it, those tests fail but single-user tests are unaffected. Create a second API key in the Aurora UI and populate `S3_ALT_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `S3_ALT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in `.env`.

**3. Python 3.10+**

The test harness requires Python 3.10 or newer (pytest 9+ dependency). Verify:

```bash
python --version
```

**4. ceph-s3-tests submodule is initialized**

```bash
# From the tests/s3compat/ directory
ls ceph-s3-tests/   # should exist
# If not:
git submodule update --init tests/s3compat/ceph-s3-tests
```

**5. Dependencies installed**

```bash
# ceph-s3-tests dependencies (munch, gevent, isodate, etc.)
uv pip install -r ceph-s3-tests/requirements.txt

# Our test harness (only needed for compatibility_test.py)
uv sync
```

**6. STS / IAM tests require additional Aurora configuration**

The STS and IAM test files (`test_sts.py`, `test_iam.py`) require Aurora to support those APIs. If Aurora does not expose an IAM/STS endpoint, skip those files entirely:

```bash
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_s3.py  # core S3 only
```

The `webidentity_test` mark additionally requires a running Keycloak instance — skip it unless you have one configured.

---

### 1. Create the config file

The suite requires an INI config file. You can either auto-generate it from your `.env` or create it manually.

**Option A: Auto-generate from `.env`**

```bash
uv run python tools/generate_ceph_conf.py akave   # or aurora, fth, etc.
```

This creates `ceph-s3-tests/s3tests.conf` with all sections populated from your provider's `.env`.

**Option B: Create manually**

Copy and fill in this template, saving it as `ceph-s3-tests/aurora.conf`:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
host = a-s3.aur.lu
port = 443
is_secure = True
ssl_verify = True

[fixtures]
bucket prefix = aurora-s3test-{random}-

[s3 main]
display_name = Your Name
user_id      = your-user-id
email        = you@example.com
access_key   = <S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
secret_key   = <S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

[s3 alt]
display_name = Alt User
user_id      = your-alt-user-id
email        = alt@example.com
access_key   = <S3_ALT_ACCESS_KEY_ID>   # must be a separate Aurora account for cross-user tests
secret_key   = <S3_ALT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

[s3 tenant]
display_name = Tenant User
user_id      = aurora-tenant-user
email        = tenant@aurora.test
access_key   = <S3_ALT_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
secret_key   = <S3_ALT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
tenant       = aurora-tenant

[iam]
display_name = IAM User
user_id      = aurora-iam-user
email        = iam@aurora.test
access_key   = <S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
secret_key   = <S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

[iam root]
access_key = <S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
secret_key = <S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
user_id    = aurora-main-user
email      = you@example.com

[iam alt root]
access_key = <S3_ALT_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
secret_key = <S3_ALT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
user_id    = aurora-alt-user
email      = alt@example.com
```

### 2. Run with tox

Tox installs the suite's dependencies into an isolated virtualenv automatically:

```bash
cd ceph-s3-tests

# Run all tests
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf tox

# Run only the core S3 tests
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf tox -- s3tests/functional/test_s3.py

# Run a specific test
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf tox -- s3tests/functional/test_s3.py::test_bucket_list_empty
```

### 3. Run with pytest directly

If dependencies are already installed (`uv pip install -r ceph-s3-tests/requirements.txt`), use pytest directly from the `ceph-s3-tests` directory for faster startup:

```bash
cd ceph-s3-tests

# All core S3 tests
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_s3.py

# A single test
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_s3.py::test_bucket_list_empty

# STS tests
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_sts.py

# IAM tests
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_iam.py
```

### 4. Filter by marks

Tests are tagged with marks describing their feature area or known failure conditions. Combine them with standard boolean expressions:

```bash
# Skip tests known to fail on real AWS (good baseline for any S3-compatible service)
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_s3.py -m 'not fails_on_aws'

# Only versioning tests
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_s3.py -m versioning

# Versioning tests that aren't expected to fail on AWS
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_s3.py -m 'versioning and not fails_on_aws'

# Encryption tests
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_s3.py -m encryption

# Object lock tests
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_s3.py -m object_lock

# Lifecycle tests
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_s3.py -m lifecycle

# STS: AssumeRole and GetSessionToken only
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_sts.py -m test_of_sts

# STS: AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity (requires Keycloak)
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_sts.py -m webidentity_test

# Bucket logging (with Ceph rollover extension)
S3TEST_CONF=aurora.conf pytest s3tests/functional/test_s3.py -m bucket_logging
```

Key marks to know:

| Mark                    | Meaning                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fails_on_aws`          | Known to fail on real AWS S3 — likely fails on Aurora too |
| `fails_on_rgw`          | Ceph-specific failure — may pass on Aurora                |
| `versioning`            | Object versioning tests                                   |
| `lifecycle`             | Lifecycle policy tests                                    |
| `encryption` / `sse_s3` | Server-side encryption                                    |
| `object_lock`           | Object lock / retention                                   |
| `tagging`               | Object and bucket tagging                                 |
| `bucket_policy`         | Bucket policy tests                                       |
| `checksum`              | Checksum validation                                       |
| `test_of_sts`           | STS AssumeRole / GetSessionToken                          |
| `webidentity_test`      | STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity (needs Keycloak)            |

### Tox vs. compatibility_test.py

|              | `tox` / `pytest` directly               | `compatibility_test.py`                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Config       | Manual (`aurora.conf`)                  | Auto-generated from `.env`                      |
| Output       | Raw pytest terminal output              | Unified timestamped report                      |
| Timing stats | No                                      | Yes (avg, stddev, min, max per category)        |
| Resume       | No                                      | N/A (tests are fast enough to re-run)           |
| Best for     | Quick iteration, debugging single tests | Full compatibility runs with reportable results |

### Adding per-onramp patches

Each on-ramp's backend code lives under `lib/backend-<provider>/`, separate
from the provider's runtime data (`aurora/`, `akave/`, `fth/` — `.env`, logs,
reports) and CLIs. To add e.g. an Akave-specific `put_bucket_cors` workaround:

1. Create `lib/backend-akave/__init__.py` exposing `def activate(): ...` —
   typically split into `patch.py` (boto3 monkey-patches) + `portal_api.py`
   (HTTP wire layer), mirroring `lib/backend-aurora/`. Provider-specific CLIs
   go under the top-level `tools/` directory, prefixed with the provider name
   (e.g. `tools/akave_key_management.py`).
2. Optionally export module-level `SKIP_TESTS = {...}` and `SKIP_REASON = "..."`
   to auto-skip tests that don't apply to that on-ramp.
3. Run `python compatibility_test.py --provider akave` — `backend_loader`
   imports `lib.backend-akave` and calls `activate()` at pytest startup.

No edits to `compatibility_test.py` or `backend_loader.py` are required.
